# M102 - MongoDB for DBAs

###About this course

Learn everything you need to know to administer a MongoDB installation in production. This course begins by assuming you have no experience with MongoDB, taking you through the basics of installation. Then you will learn about JSON and Mongo's extensive query capabilities through the Mongo shell. We will cover importing, and exporting data into Mongo. After that, we cover replication and fault tolerance. Then it is on to scaling out with MongoDB, including indexing, performance tuning, monitoring, and sharding. Finally, we cover backups and recovery. No prior experience with MongoDB is assumed for this course but a knowledge of administration of another database will be helpful.

### Prerequisites

Basic system administration skills. A working knowledge of relational database concepts is helpful but not required. Javascript is the shell language for MongoDB and rudimentary knowledge of that is also helpful, but not required.
